                               As BPD provides a bill-through service for sponsored listings, the company takes a significant credit risk for each and every Client. Therefore, the Client is responsible to maintain an active and valid payment method on file at all times.</p><br/><p> If for any reason, Client’s payment method is not available, BPD reserves the right to immediately and temporarily turn off the website, pay-per-click ads, sponsored listings and ongoing or then current production, reporting, or support Services being provided to account.</p><br/><p> If the payment is not received, BPD reserves the right to terminate the Agreement in full and retain ownership of the web site, or other Services until such time the account has been paid in full. All Term Commitment Terminations will result in an escalation of all fees owed under the Terms of the Agreement. </p><br/><p> Many clients maintain multiple forms of payment on file to prevent this from occurring.
